To implement Step 6, which involves security and monitoring in PostgreSQL, you can use the following code as a guide:

1. Implement encryption for sensitive data:
- Use cryptographic functions to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.
- PostgreSQL provides various encryption functions like `pgp_sym_encrypt` and `pgp_sym_decrypt` that you can use to encrypt and decrypt data.

2. Implement user activity monitoring and logging:
- Create a new table to store logs of important events or transactions. For example, you can create a table named "ActivityLogs" with columns like log_id, user_id, event_type, event_description, and log_date.
- Whenever a significant transaction or event occurs, insert a new record into the "ActivityLogs" table with relevant information, including the user ID, event type, description, and timestamp.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ActivityLogs (
  log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER,
  event_type VARCHAR(50),
  event_description VARCHAR(200),
  log_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert a log record
INSERT INTO ActivityLogs (user_id, event_type, event_description, log_date)
VALUES (1, 'Transaction', 'Withdrawal of $500', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

3. Generate transaction history reports:
- Utilize SQL queries to generate reports based on transaction history.
- For example, you can retrieve transaction details for a specific user or within a certain date range.

Example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id = 1
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC;
```

4. Implement user access control and permissions:
- Use PostgreSQL's built-in user and role management system to control access and permissions for different users and roles within your system.
- Grant appropriate privileges to users and roles based on their responsibilities and access requirements.

Remember to consider data privacy regulations and security best practices while implementing security measures. It is also crucial to handle potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks, by using parameterized queries or prepared statements, and input sanitization.
