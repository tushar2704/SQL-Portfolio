## Introduction

In this project, we leverage SQL to manipulate and analyze the dataset from BusinessFinancing.co.uk, which contains information about the world's oldest businesses. By examining the founding dates and industries, we aim to gain insights into the longevity of businesses across different sectors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from BusinessFinancing.co.uk. It includes the following columns:

- `company_name`: The name of the company.
- `founding_date`: The date when the company was founded.
- `industry`: The industry to which the company belongs.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file.
- `sql_scripts/`: Includes the SQL scripts for data preparation, analysis, and queries.
- `results/`: Stores the output files and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project (you are here).

## Setup Instructions

To run the SQL scripts and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-oldest-building-in-the-world.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have an SQL database management system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

3. Import the dataset into your database.

4. Open your preferred SQL client and connect to your database.

5. Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql_scripts/` directory in the specified order to perform data cleaning, analysis, and queries.

## Usage

The SQL scripts in the `sql_scripts/` directory can be executed individually or sequentially, depending on the analysis you want to perform. Refer to the comments in each script for guidance on its purpose and usage.

Feel free to modify the scripts and explore additional questions or analyses based on your interests.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including summary statistics, visualizations, and query outputs, are stored in the `results/` directory. These outputs provide insights into the founding dates and industries of the oldest businesses in the dataset.
